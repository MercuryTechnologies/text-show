# 0.5
* Removed `containers` and `time` as dependencies. The modules for the data types in these libraries were migrated to a separate library, `text-show-instances`.
* The type signatures of lambda expressions generated by `mkShow` and related functions were loosened to allow them to be used to "manually" derive `Show` instances for data types with higher-kinded type parameters or type arguments with restricted `Show` instances. This should not be a breaking change; you can simply do more with `mkShow` et al. than you could before. For more information, see the documentation in `Text.Show.Text.TH`.
* Loosened the `Show` instance of `Complex a` tp only depend on `Show a` (previously required `RealFloat a`)
* Moved `showbRatioPrec` to `Text.Show.Text.Data.Ratio`, `showbComplexPrec` to `Text.Show.Text.Data.Complex`, `showbProxy` to `Text.Show.Text.Data.Proxy`, and `showbFingerprint` to `Text.Show.Text.GHC.Fingerprint`
* Added `showbSpace` to `Text.Show.Text`
* Added `mkShowList`, `mkShowListLazy`, and `mkShowbList` to `Text.Data.Text.TH`
* Added the `Text.Show.Text.Data.OldTypeable` module for base >= 4.7
* Added `Text.Show.Text.Debug.Trace` and `Text.Show.Text.Debug.Trace.TH`
* Added the `Show1` class and corresponding instances for unary type constructors.
* Exported `asciiTabB` in `Text.Show.Text.Data.Char`

## 0.4.1
* Added the utility functions `toStrictText` and `toString` for working with `Builder`s.

# 0.4
* Due to [GHC bug #5289](http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5289), projects that depend on the `double-conversion` library (such as `text-format`, a dependency of `text-show`) may break due to GHC incorrectly linking against libstdc++. Therefore, `text-show` was changed so that it does not depend on `text-format` by default. This behavior can be changed by using the `-ftext-format` flag when using `cabal`.
* Added `showbZonedTime` to `Text.Show.Text.Data.Time` (and corresponding `Show` instance for `ZonedTime`)
* Exposed `showbMaskingState` (is was already there, I just forgot to export it)
* If using GHC 7.6 or earlier, depend on tagged so that `Data.Proxy` (and thus `showbProxy` from `Text.Show.Text.Data.Typeable`) can be used
* Refactored code to use Template Haskell derivations when possible

## 0.3.1.0
* Added `showList` and `showListLazy`
* Don't use showbListDefault to show `containers` data types
* Added the ability to splice `show` functions for arbitrary data types (even if they aren't `Show` instances). These functions are `mkShow`, `mkShowLazy`, `mkShowPrec`, `mkShowPrecLazy`, `mkShowb`, `mkShowbPrec`, `mkPrint`, `mkPrintLazy`, `mkHPrint`, and `mkHPrintLazy`.

# 0.3.0.0
* Lots of bugfixes
* `Show` instances for many other data types in `base`, `containers` and `time`
* Exposed internal modules with monomorphic functions
* `Text.Show.Text` now exports `Data.Text.Lazy.Builder` for convenience
* Add `showLazy`, `showPrec`, `showPrecLazy`, `printLazy`, `hPrint`, `hPrintLazy`, `lengthB`, and `replicateB`
* Template Haskell derivation of `Show` instances (doesn't support data families yet)

# 0.2.0.0
* Added `Show` instances for strict and lazy `Text`

# 0.1.0.0
* Initial commit
